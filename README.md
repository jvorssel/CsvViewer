# .NET CsvViewer
I couldn't find a quick and easy CSV viewer and I didn't want to open Excel every time so I created one.

#### Summary

* Able to load really large files (> 1GB).
* Fast, simple and easy to use.
* Pagination for improved performance on older systems.
* Conditional search for a value in a column.
* Smaller files (< 50MB) are loaded in-memory to improve speed.
* Alot of options to view a CSV file in the correct way.
* Figues out what delimiter to use on load.

#### Feedback
This is a simple, two-day build that has been tested thoroughly. <br>
